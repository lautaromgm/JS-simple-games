A few games that I made from a freecodecamp video with Anya Kub√≥w, for the whack a mole I recycled some code from the memory game and made the funcionality by myself without watching, and for the break out I tried to do as much as I could alone, looking for a hint here and there but not much to challenge me and learn, the collision part drived me crazy haha and I added a system of flags on keydown and keyup to make the movement more fluid without the OS delay on keypress.
